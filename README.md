# Abstract
This project is an investment return comparator. It compares historical data of returns of public retirement options in Mexico against historical returns of various stock markets. 
# Introduction
In Mexico, retirement fund options are very limited, confusing, or dispersed. It is difficult for the average person to be aware of all the options available in the public and private sectors. So this project arises as an option where they can see a lot of options, and compare yields of various investment options beyond the public ones, some low risk and secure but also low yields or some that are more high risk but higher yields. See what option is more suitable for you and help you make a better decision.
# Importance
This project aims to inspire users to invest and build financial independence. In Mexico, investment culture is limited, so our mission is to promote it and empower individuals with information so they can make conscious decisions.
